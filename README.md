# Show the caret position of authors on your Etherpad um, Pad.

Important: A caret is not a cursor, a cursor is what your mouse uses.. A caret is the little stick used in a word processor.  The more you know....

## Features
* See where the author is in really real time
* Click on an authors colored icon block to follow that author as they move around a pad
* I needed a third feature so let's go with free NFC Ring for anyone who spots this crazy "feature"

## Customization

By default, the caret indicator is rendered for 2 seconds, then it fades out. If you want to change this behavior, you can configure your `settings.json`:

```
  "ep_cursortrace":{
    "fade_out_timeout": 2000 // in milliseconds. A 0 timeout means caret indicators are never hidden
  }
```

## TODO

* Avoid race condition where the ACE object is sent and the cursor but the cursor arrives before the event

* Add a buffer

* Show the stick on the right when the righter px of the span is greater than the total width of outerdocbody IE the name doesnt fit on the screen

* Test Coverage

* Show the authors location (When in follow mode) even if the author doesn't type anything (means storing authors last known locations)
